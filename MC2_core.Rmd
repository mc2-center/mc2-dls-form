## Resource sharing details

To help Sage Bionetworks understand how we can support your resource sharing efforts, please provide the information requested below concerning the resources to be shared.

### Directions for survey

**Type your answers into the table cells below. Controlled fields will display terms we have on file when you begin typing. You are not required to select a term from this list if a suitable entry is not currently available. For each assay, tool, or model, please add a separate row to the corresponding table.**

### Datasets
#### Fields:
- **Assay**: Controlled field; the assay used to generate the dataset that will be shared

- **Format**: Controlled field; the format used to store the shared data

- **Sample count**: The number of samples for which data will be shared. For single cell experiments, each cell should be counted as a single sample.

- **Species**: Controlled field; the species of origin for the dataset being shared. _Human-derived data may require specific resource sharing considerations._

- **Data repository**: Name of the storage service where data will be housed.

- **Planned upload date**: The date by which you plan to upload data to the identified repository.
